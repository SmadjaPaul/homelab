# Cursor Rules for Homelab BMad Method Project

## Project Context
This is a homelab configuration project using the BMad Method for structured development.

## Key Principles
- Always use fresh chats when switching between BMad workflows
- Follow the BMad Method phases: Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation
- Keep generated artifacts in `_bmad-output/` separate from source code
- Maintain clean separation between infrastructure code and BMad planning documents

## BMad Workflow Commands
- `*workflow-init` - Initialize project (Analyst agent)
- `*workflow-status` - Check progress (Any agent)
- `*prd` - Create Product Requirements Document (PM agent)
- `*create-architecture` - Create architecture document (Architect agent)
- `*create-epics-and-stories` - Break down into epics (PM agent)
- `*sprint-planning` - Initialize sprint tracking (SM agent)
- `*dev-story` - Implement a story (DEV agent)
- `*code-review` - Review code (DEV agent)

## File Organization
- Planning documents: `_bmad-output/`
- Infrastructure code: `infrastructure/` or `services/`
- Documentation: `docs/` or root `README.md`
